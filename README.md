# javascript-challenge

Homework submission, week 14

## Summary
Project uses D3 to read JSON data file, produces a summary table with D3 and two plots using Plotly.

Web page updates each time a new datapoint is selected from a dropdown.

## Files

- index.html - single HTML file
- static/js/app.js - single javascript code
- samples.json - data input file

All files are also replicated in the 'docs' folder for deployment purposes

### Comments
Source code is functional and working. Could potentially be improved by greater use of functions rather than primary code
